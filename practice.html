        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h2>Our story</h2>
        <p>GreenGo was born from a simple belief: food should be grown the way nature intended. Established in 2025 in
            Udumalpet, our farm started as a family venture and has since blossomed into a thriving organic movement.

        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>At GreenGo, we believe farming isn‚Äôt just about growing food ‚Äî it‚Äôs about growing trust,
            sustainability, and health. Our philosophy is rooted in three core values: care for the earth, care for
            people, and respect for nature‚Äôs rhythm.
            We don‚Äôt cut corners with chemicals or quick fixes. Instead, we invest time in the soil, use natural
            methods, and grow food that‚Äôs truly clean from seed to harvest. Every decision we make on the farm reflects
            our commitment to creating a better food system ‚Äî one that‚Äôs ethical, eco-friendly, and nourishing for
            everyone.</p>
        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>Our journey began with a simple question: What if farming could heal the earth instead of harm it?
            From a small patch of land and a big dream, GreenGo was born. We started with compost, old seeds,
            and lots of learning ‚Äî and grew into a thriving organic farm powered by purpose.
            Every step we‚Äôve taken ‚Äî from hand-turning soil to harvesting our first organic vegetables ‚Äî has been rooted
            in a belief that nature knows best. Today, we invite you to be part of that journey and rediscover food the
            way it‚Äôs meant to be.
        </p>
        <h2>Why We Farm Organically</h2>
        <p>We farm organically because we care ‚Äî about your health, our land, and the future of food.
            Conventional agriculture may feed the world fast, but at what cost? Soil depletion, pesticide residues, and
            damage to nature aren't worth the trade.
            That‚Äôs why at GreenGo, we choose a better way: one that nourishes the earth, keeps chemicals out of
            your kitchen, and helps restore the natural balance. Organic isn‚Äôt just what we do ‚Äî it‚Äôs what we believe
            in.
